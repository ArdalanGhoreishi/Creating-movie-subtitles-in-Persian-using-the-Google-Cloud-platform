00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
 Let's see what we have here.

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,600
 Must be a student film hours x-rays.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,400
 Broken rigged.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,800
 His joints are all over the place.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
 Anything else like this in history?

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,500
 No doctor only blend shapes Burmese capital.

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,100
 Dr.

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,400
 You forgot to remove the key.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,200
 How's he looking?

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,800
 We need to hurry.

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,500
 His frame rate is dropping fast by the

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,700
 rest in post grab me.

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,700
 Something to fill this hole.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,400
 There's nothing here.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,700
 It must be on another shelf.

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,200
 Left emerge,

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,900
 a manually.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
 I can do this.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,100
 It's gonna be okay.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,100
 It's too late.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,200
 He's lost the illusion of life.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,500
 No, we can reanimate him.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,700
 We're gonna do this.

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,600
 The old-fashioned way,

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
 I have to push his post by hand will need

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,600
 follow through for me,

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,200
 50 ccs,

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,300
 of squash and stretch charge an IPR clear.

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,200
 Put on pause.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,300
 So we can finish up here.

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,600
 Do you think he'll pull through maths

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,000
 and accounting for a second pass?

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,600
 But sure,

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,600
 guess that means we'll be working more

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,200
 with 3D,

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,600
 huh?

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,200
 Please.

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,300
 I can't imagine the kind of lunatic that

39
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,400
 want to do that for a living.
